8/10/23, 19:49 - Jaishree YMCA: It has been brought into the notice of TPO office that after even giving constant information about correct filling of educational details on POD , still many students are trying to manipulate the information at there own. These type of students should refrain from such activities as indulgence in any of these activities such as (Not declaring there re-appears, filling wrong sgpa / cgpa, without declaration of results filling there sgpa even they have reappear in that semester etc.) 

This is a last warning for all and any student if found guilty in any of the company's drive will be blocked for the entire placement season. 

Thanks

8/14/23, 20:44 - Jaishree YMCA: All the CRs are requested to kindly tell students of your class that everyone has to fill the SGPA in the aggregate grade section for each Semester in education section on Pod.ai

If you have filled the CGPA then it will create a trouble for you. So kindly update this section by filling SGPA
.
It will automatically calculate the actual CGPA.

Filling incorrect details will do injustice with the students who have filled correct details. So if TPO founds any misinformation related to your academic details then you might get blocked from further placement process. So kindly fill the correct details and update it.
